<h1>Places To Eat</h1>
<section>
<h2>1. The Dream Diner</h2>

<p>Classic American vibes meet a pink aesthetic. Pancakes, milkshakes, and fun retro booths await! The menu is as playful as it is pretty — think heart-shaped pancakes, glitter-topped milkshakes, and perfectly stacked plastic burgers that never fall apart. Barbie herself might greet you with a wink as she pours a cup of (pretend) coffee. Whether you’re snapping photos under the “Dream Big, Eat Pink” sign or grooving to the diner’s jukebox hits, every meal here feels like a slice of nostalgic magic.</p>

<h2>2. Café Malibu</h2>

<p>Enjoy lattes topped with heart-shaped foam and light lunches by the beachside, surrounded by pastel umbrellas. The air smells faintly of coconut and sea breeze, and the vibe is effortlessly chic. Order a (pretend) acai bowl, sip a pink lemonade, and chat with friends as the waves sparkle nearby. It’s the perfect place to unwind between Dreamhouse tours or beach volleyball matches, where every moment feels like a summer postcard.</p>

<h2>3. Ken’s Grill</h2>

<p>Ken’s favorite spot for BBQ with a side of style. Try the pink lemonade while relaxing to beach tunes. Picture a beachside barbecue run entirely by Kens — sunglasses on, aprons off, and surfboards propped by the grill. The menu? Burgers, hot dogs, and “manly” smoothies (which are really just protein shakes with glitter on top). Expect a lot of high-fives, friendly competitions, and enthusiastic but slightly chaotic cooking. It’s less about gourmet dining and more about good vibes and grilled fun — because in Ken’s words, “No one does beach barbecue like a Ken.”</p>
