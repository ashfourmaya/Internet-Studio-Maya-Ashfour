    <h1> Part 2 Questions</h1>
  <p> What is the difference between structured content and semantic HTML? Structured content refers to organizing content into meaningful “chunks” (or data modules) whose relationships are explicitly modeled. These are not just pages, but bits of content (think: metadata, clearly defined fields, content types) that are built outside of a specific presentation/interface so they can be repurposed, recombined, remixed, or delivered via different kinds of interfaces (voice, mobile, chatbots, etc.) Semantic HTML is about using HTML markup that describes meaning rather than just appearance. That means using the right HTML elements (headings <h1>–<h6>, lists <ul>, <ol>, paragraphs <p>, sections, article, nav, etc.) so that both humans and machines (e.g. search engines, screen readers) can perceive the structure and hierarchy of content. It’s not just “make it look right” but “make its meaning / structure explicit in the code.
<br> 
How do they work together?
They reinforce each other, and together they enable smarter, more flexible content use.
<br>
Why is it important to have both on your web pages? Better discovery & usage by machines / smart agents, Consistency across channels / interfaces,
Improved user experience and correctness, Business advantage / competitive edge.
