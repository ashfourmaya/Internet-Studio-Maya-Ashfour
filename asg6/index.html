	<h1>White Hat</h1>
	<p>
		We know that the project’s goal is to create a website where people in the same community can rent or buy clothing from one another, promoting sustainability and reducing dependence on fast fashion. We already understand the problem: fast fashion contributes to waste, pollution, and unethical labor. We also know that people are becoming more environmentally conscious and interested in sustainable options. However, we still need specific information about the target audience—such as their age, style preferences, and willingness to rent clothing online. We also need to research competitors like Poshmark or Rent the Runway to see what features are most effective. Key questions include: How will transactions be managed safely? How will clothing quality be verified? To gather this information, we can use surveys, focus groups, or interviews within local communities and research successful sustainability-based fashion platforms.

	<h2>Red Hat</h2>
<p>
	Emotionally, this project feels exciting and empowering. There is a strong sense of purpose behind supporting sustainability and connecting communities. Intuitively, it feels like people—especially younger generations—are ready for change in how they consume fashion. There’s also a feeling of pride in creating something that aligns with personal values and helps reduce waste. However, there may be underlying worries about whether users will actually trust others enough to rent or buy used clothing locally, and whether the platform will attract enough participation to be sustainable. These mixed emotions reflect both optimism and a healthy sense of caution about the project’s challenges.

	<h3>Black Hat</h3>
<p>
	The main problems with the project could include issues with quality control, cleanliness of items, and user trust. People might hesitate to rent clothes from strangers or might worry about damage or unfair pricing. Another concern is logistics—how will exchanges take place, and what if someone doesn’t return an item? There could also be technical problems, such as maintaining secure payments and preventing scams. From a market standpoint, competition is another risk since there are already established resale platforms. If these issues aren’t handled well, users might lose confidence in the website quickly. It’s essential to anticipate these potential downsides to make the platform reliable and safe.

	<h4>Yellow Hat</h4>
<p>
	Despite the challenges, this project has strong potential to succeed because it aligns with growing consumer interest in sustainability and ethical consumption. It adds value by promoting local connections, saving users money, and giving new life to unused clothing. If designed well, it can also strengthen community ties and encourage environmental awareness. To make it work, we can include user ratings, verified profiles, and built-in cleaning or return policies to ensure trust. The project could also partner with local thrift stores or eco-friendly brands to increase appeal. The potential social and environmental benefits make this concept both valuable and timely.
</p>

	<h5>Green Hat</h5>
<p>
	There are many creative directions to explore. The website could include features like clothing swap events, repair tutorials, or sustainability badges for active users. An app version could make it easy to browse or schedule pickups. We could also include a “style match” system that recommends people with similar sizes or fashion preferences. To address Black Hat concerns, the platform might introduce optional deposits or insurance for rented clothes. Another idea is to use eco-points or rewards to encourage continued participation. Thinking beyond just transactions, this project could evolve into a full community hub for sharing, learning, and promoting sustainable fashion habits.

	<h6>Blue Hat</h6>
	<p>
		The main subject of our discussion is developing a community-based website for renting and buying clothes sustainably. Our goal is to create a platform that is practical, trustworthy, and environmentally conscious. To stay on track, we need to focus on clear research, realistic implementation, and creative problem-solving. The conclusions from each hat are: gather more user data (White), recognize both excitement and hesitation (Red), address potential risks (Black), emphasize social and environmental value (Yellow), and explore innovative features (Green). This structured reflection helps ensure that the project remains balanced—fact-based, emotionally aware, and creatively inspired while staying grounded in real-world feasibility.

	<p>
		My project has not changed too much after this discussion. Some things I have to take into consideration though is user trust. I fear clients will not properly return items that they rent. But I am thinking I could just implement a 'fee' system. I am really excited about this project honestly. I think that it is going to be a really cool idea and I hope to exicute it well.	I also want to make it to wear you could not only rent out items, but also buy and seel. I think that would be fun. Ive usually only seen popular sites only sell or only rent. but i want to implement both.
