	<h1>My 3 Possible Domain Names</h1>
	<p>
		 <ul>
		<li>  StyleSwap.shop </li>
		<li>  FitRent.shop </li>
		<li>  tRENTy.com </li>
	</ul>
	</p>

	<h2>Classmate Disucussion</h2>
	<p>Me and my friend had a brief discussion about what my domain name should be. We think maybe it should for sure use the .shop ending, since it is a fashion related website. We wanted it to include somthing that had to do with swapping or renting or trading, but I am still deciding what the name should be. 
	We liked the StyleSwap idea the most I think. Since I want it to cater to rentiing and/or buying thinks, not just renting. And I feel like 'swap' can apply to both concepts.</p>

	<h3>Domain I Like Best and Why</h3>
	<p>
		I think the domain I like best is ulimitly StyleSwap.shop. I think this one suits the concept and idea of my website best. I also like how it has a nice ring to the name, considering both words are short, and start with an S.
