	<p> From the Better User Experience Through Storytelling Articles: How can framing your project in a story format help you refine your ideas? Write a paragraph explanation.: Framing a UX project in a story format helps refine ideas in several ways: it forces you to define who the user is (the protagonist), what their goal or challenge is, why they care, and how they move through the experience. That narrative structure brings clarity: it reveals missing or weak parts of your idea (scenes that don’t flow, unclear motivations, or gaps in the user journey). It helps the team align on what matters most — the emotional arc, not just features. Also, because stories are concrete, rather than abstract, they expose assumptions: once you try to imagine the story from start to finish, you hit places where you don’t really know the user’s context, what information they’ll need, when they’ll need it, etc. This lets you prune unnecessary features, prioritize what supports the core narrative, and generally sharpen the design toward a more coherent, compelling, and user-centered experience.
